# Bamazon

## Description
This is a shopping app that is ran inside of the command line.  When running bamazonCustomer.js, customers will be shown a table of the items available, including the product name and price.  The customer will then be prompted to choose a product and the quantity of that product.  If it is in stock... SUCCESS!!  A total amount will appear followed by a prompt to continue shopping.  If the quantity requested is not available, a message will be displayed to the customer stating such.

## NPM Packages Used
* mysql (used to store the product information in a database to be pulled using Node)
* inquirer (used to prompt the customer for the product, quantity, and if they'd wish to continue shopping)
